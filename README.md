This program is meant to take in user inputs and give the outputs needed to design a rocket engine. To use, install in a code editor like vscode and download the following python libraries:

1. NumPy
2. SciPy
3. Pandas
4. MatPlotLib
5. RocketCEA

From there, you can run python main.py and get the system started. Future tasks include csv outputs, basic engineering drawings, and a full set of documentation and code pipelines. Theory documentation is found in /Documentation.
