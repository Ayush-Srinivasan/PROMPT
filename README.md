This program is meant to take in user inputs and give the outputs needed to design a rocket engine. To use, install in a code editor like vscode and download the following python libraries using the following command:

python -m pip install -r requirements.txt

From there, you can run python main.py and get the system started. Future tasks include csv outputs, basic engineering drawings, and a full set of documentation and code pipelines. Documentation and the user manual can be found in /Documentation.
